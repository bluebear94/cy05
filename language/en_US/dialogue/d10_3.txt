I'm glad I wore a nice coat~
0
I can hardly see in this blizzard, though.

When is it going to stop?

I hope it never does.
1
It's fine. I brought a nice coat.
0
I was lying that time. The nymphs want to be warm.
0
And "look at the trees", as they said!
0
If there are no trees, there's no oxygen either!
0
Wait... that makes sense.
1
You know about Vija, though, right?
1
Eh heh, Vija seems to be a nice person.
0
I'll see Vija later.

Anyway, let me introduce myself.
1
[ruby rb="Arcame Dernar" rt="Keeper of Vanar-Cyren"]
3
Arcame Dernar, the keeper of this castle.
1
Elssecisso Rencron, last of the Protectors.

You look brave, Esel Rygen.
1
Iyaaah, I think Rencron would like to fight you over the blizzard.
0
I'm no Protector myself, but the nymphs have feelings.
0
Of course, you're only 11/64-blooded.
1
How am I supposed to value your opinion?
1
And why should Vija value yours?
0
Vija (at a distance): &osb; WHAT, WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT ME? &csb;
2
&osb; I PREFER THAT WE AVOID DISCUSSING THIS MATTER. &csb;
2
&osb; AFTER ALL, IT IS IRRELEVANT IN MODERN TIMES. &csb;
2
Then I shall stop the snowfall if you manage to defeat me in battle.
1
Eh heh, you seem weak.
