Elemental Points
Elemental points come in four types: air (yellow), earth (green), water (blue), and fire (red).[r]* Air points are gained by using spellcards. Having more air points will lengthen the deathbomb window and decrease the number of fragments required for spellcards.[r]* Earth points are gained by surviving and decrease the number of fragments required for lives.[r]* Water points are gained by grazing and increase the point item value gained by grazing.[r]* Fire points are gained by collecting point items. They increase the number of elemental points gained and lower the line at which items are automatically collected. Being hit will decrease the number of elemental points.
