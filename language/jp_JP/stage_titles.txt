木の内に重なるモノ
森の道
森の道は[r]&nbsp;地面が雪に覆われて[r]&nbsp;&nbsp;誰もなぜかわからなかった
Pile of Bones at the Iron Gate
Path in Front of the Castle
The snow does not stop;[r]&nbsp;little time remains[r]&nbsp;&nbsp;before the land becomes a graveyard of trees.
To Where Points the Nose?
Lightless Halls of Vanar
The halls of the fortress are pitch dark[r]&nbsp;Who hides in the shadows?
Blue Glow of Warning
The Library
Light passing the ice[r]&nbsp;floods the room.[r]&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue glow signals the little time remaining.
Omen Chiseled in Sandstone
Hall of Rekindled Spirits
Here is a resting-place[r]&nbsp;from the wrathful cold winds[r]&nbsp;&nbsp;yet it might be too hot.
Under the Dim Surface of the Water
The Great Canal
Look to the end[r]&nbsp;and realize how far you still are[r]&nbsp;&nbsp;from the end.
